<p style="color:yellow"> Person 3 agree yes  I am, What are you going to do about it?</p>
<p style="color:green"> Person 2 says that's not okay, sir (Person 3). What's your name?</p>

<p style="color:yellow"> Person 3 was scared and said nothing.</p>
<p style="color:green"> The Officer (person 2) says, "Can I see your driver's license?" to person 3.</p>
<p style="color:yellow"> Person 3 reply: here you go, take a look!</p>
